# Spotify Clone

**The development environment is set up using Vite.js:**
Vite.js template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Quick Start
To begin, clone this repository to your local machine and use npm to install the necessary modules.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ricotandrio/clone-spotify.git
$ cd clone-spotify
$ npm install
```

To run the development server, create a `.env` file and fill it with your own Firebase authentications details and Spotify client ID. Then, execute the following command:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
